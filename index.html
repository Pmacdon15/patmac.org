        <h2>A little bit about my self</h2>
        <img class="displayImg" src="images/limoDriver.jpg" alt="Limo Driver" />
        <p>
          My name is Patrick MacDonald, and I've created this site as a stepping
          stone towards securing a position in the tech industry. Let me take
          you on a journey from my initial career endeavors to my burgeoning
          interest in Software Development. At the age of 22, I embarked on a
          driving career, a decision fueled by a string of challenging,
          low-paying jobs and a desire for change. With youthful exuberance and
          a belief that I could take on the world, I chose truck driving,
          imagining the thrill of navigating the vastness in large trucks—and
          indeed, it was exhilarating.
        </p>
        <img
          class="displayImg"
          src="images/truckDriver.jpg"
          alt="Truck Driver"
        />
        <p>
          My career as a truck driver was a source of pride, yet it was also
          marred by exhaustion and financial stagnation. Despite earning a
          decent wage, I found myself living paycheck to paycheck, unable to
          save and often caught in the unexpected delays of the job—like waiting
          for a mechanic when a tire burst or a truck malfunctioned, or
          coordinating pickups for my stepdaughter due to work delays. The
          allure of the open road was dampened by the reality of being at the
          mercy of the elements, leading me to yearn for a significant change.
        </p>
        <p>
          This desire for change sparked a period of introspection. I reminisced
          about my high school days, where programming captivated me, offering
          both a challenge and a unique form of expression. Motivated by this
          realization, I pursued my GED, a milestone achieved in about a month,
          and subsequently applied to the software development program at Bow
          Valley College. Although initially wait listed, I utilized the interim
          to enrich my understanding through online courses on Udemy,
          reaffirming my passion for software development. By January, I was
          officially a student at Bow Valley, embarking on a new chapter in my
          life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, as I navigate through my third term, with a strategic break
          planned for the upcoming spring and summer, I am eagerly seeking an
          internship or part-time opportunity in software development. This
          transition marks not just a shift in my career path but a significant
          step towards realizing my potential in the tech industry. With two
          terms remaining after my break, I am committed to leveraging this time
          to further hone my skills and prepare for a rewarding career in
          software development.
        </p>
        <p>
          This site serves as a testament to my journey and a beacon for
          potential opportunities that lie ahead. I look forward to connecting
          with like-minded individuals and organizations keen on nurturing
          talent and innovation in the tech landscape.
