        <h2>A little bit about my self</h2>
        <img class="displayImg" src="images/limoDriver.jpg" alt="Limo Driver" />
        <p>
          Hello and good day, My name is Patrick MacDonald. I'm making this site
          to aid in acquiring a job in the tech industry. I will start by
          explaining about my first career and how I got interested in Software
          Development. I started my driving career when I was 22 years old. I
          had a string of hard jobs for little pay and I was looking for a
          change. At the time I was young and very outgoing and believed I could
          conquer the world. So with that attitude I started my career as a
          truck driver because I thought it would be fun to drive large
          trucks(it was).
        </p>
        <img
          class="displayImg"
          src="images/truckDriver.jpg"
          alt="Truck Driver"
        />
        <p>
          While being proud of the career I built I was also very tired of it.
          Although I had a fairly good wage, I was unable to get a head. I was
          always living pay check to pay check not able to save very much each
          month. I would also get stuck at work when something like a tire would
          blow up or a truck would break down. I would have to wait for a
          mechanic to come then having to ask a family friend to pick up my step
          daughter from school. Also being outside in the elements was not fun.
          I know some people have it worse and being outside for an hour or so
          is not that bad but I thought there had to be another way.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's when I started an introspection and asked myself what is it I
          want to do with my life.Then I remembered how much I loved programming
          in high school and how it made me think and feel. I decided that I
          would get my GED and apply for software developmentAt Bow Valley
          College. It took me about a month to get my GED and after that I
          applied for the program and was accepted but placed on a wait list. In
          the mean time I took a few classes on udemy just to make sure that
          software development was a proper fit for me and to my surprise I
          loved it. January rolled around and I was able to start my classes at
          Bow Valley. This brings us to now where I am now entering my 3rd
          term and I am looking for an internship or some sort of part time job in the
          software development.
