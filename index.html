            <p>Hello and good day, My name is Patrick MacDonald. I'm making this site to aid in acquiring a job in the tech industry.
                I will start by explaining about my first career and how I got intrested in Software Development. I started my driving 
                career when I was 22 years old. I had a string of hard jobs for little pay and I was looking for a change. At the time 
                I was youngand very outgoingand believed I could conquer the world. So with that attitude I started my career as a 
                truck driver becuase I thought it would be fun to drive large trucks(it was).                 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Before I decided to leave my career truck driving I had over a decade of experience. I had driven all variety of vehicles 
                and delivered all varieties of product and people. I had driven a roll off garbage truck, a dump truck, a flat bed truck, a
                box truck, a charter bus, a limo, a flusher truck, a crane truck, a tow truck, a semi truck and trailer. I had delivered
                eggs, windows, roofing, people, and many other products. I had driven in all kinds of weather and all kinds of traffic. and
                all over Alberta, not to meantion lots of canada with a few road trips back to Ontario. I was experenced with very few 
                voilations and no accidents. I was a very good driver and I was proud of my career.
            </p>
            <p>
                While being proud of the career I built I was also very tired of it. Although I had a fairly good wage, I was unable to
                get a head. I was always living pay check to pay check not able to save very much each month if I was lucky. I would also get stuck 
                at work when something like a tire would blow up or a truck would break down. I would have to wait for a mechanic to come then 
                having to ask a family friend to pick up my step daughter from school. Also being outside in the elements was not fun.                 
                I know some people have it worse and being outside for an hour or so is not that bad but I 
                thought there had to be another way.

            <p>
                In high school I used to really enjoy programming. I loved the way it made me think and I liked the way I
                it challenged me. So I thought I would try to get back into it. First obstacle was obtaining my high school diploma.
                I was told that it would be fairly quick to get my GED. So in November of 2 after about a month of studying I had obtained 
                my G E D. There was not much time to apply, to to start school in January. I had been put on a waiting list so in the mean
                time I started taking online courses to confirm that my passion was still there. I took a few courses on Udemy and I really
                enjoyed it. I had learnt a bit of python and C#. I was really enjoying it and I was really looking forward to starting school.
            </p>
            <p>
                I started school in January and I was really enjoying it. I was learning a lot and I was really enjoying the challenge. 
                I was learning about HTML, CSS, Javascript, C++, and C#. I was really enjoying it and I was doing really well. That brings us
                to now. I am currently in my second semester and I am really enjoying it. That being said I needto get my foot in the door at a 
                tech company, although I am experenced in trucking, the only experince I in tech are academic or personal pursuits(like this site).
                I am hoping that this site will help me get my foot in the door and help me get a job in the tech industry.
