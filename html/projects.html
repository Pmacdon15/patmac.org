        <p>
          PatChat is a web app that I made for fun. The website<a
            href="http://www.patchat.ca"
            >PatChat.ca</a
          >
          is a chatroom, that I host on my Ubuntu server on my Raspberry Pi 4. I
          used Express and Socket.io to make the chatroom. I used pm2 to run the
          server in the background. I used apache and virtual host point to the
          desired port. Apache all handles my SSL certificate. I used Certbot to
          get the SSL certificate. I also used port forwarding to point all
          traffic on my ip address ports 80 and 443 to my Raspberry Pi and
          Apache does the rest.
        </p>

        <p>
          Creating the chat room seemed to go well after I found a video
          breaking it down to its simplest components. Another layer of
          complexity was added when I allowed Apache to handle my ssl
          certificates as opposed to setting up the express server as an HTTPS
          server to begin with. I was able to get the site to work properly
          allowing Apache to handle the SSL certificates although this method
          does generate one console error on the client side due to a connection
          failing at first. If you run it as an http server the error is gone.
          Either way this does not affect the functionality of the chat room and
          I am proud of the product I've produced.

        <p>
          The O.MG Cable is a malicious USB cable that can be used to inject key
          strokes into a victim's computer. It has a web interface that allows
          you to control the device. It is a very powerful tool that can be used
          for HID injection. Paired with a Server I made for

          I am able to launch any number of PowerShell scripts by changing one
          word on my ducky script. Anything that can be done on PowerShell can
          be done with this device. I am very impressed with the power of this
          device. Any thing from a rick roll, mapping and Extracting files, to
          obtaining the wifi password a clipboard sniffer. The O.MG cable also
          acts as a key logger as well. There are features I want to learn
          allowing the O.MG cable to be connected remotely I am looking forward
          to learning more about it.

        <h2>ALOA(A Little Offensive Appliance)</h2>

        <p>
          P4wnP1 A.L.O.A. by MaMe82 is a framework which turns a Raspberry Pi
          Zero W into a flexible, low-cost platform for Pentesting, red teaming
          and physical engagements ... or into "A Little Offensive Appliance".
          It's main super power is the ability To mimic an HID device AKA inject
          keystrokes and mouse movements into a computer. Also it is able to
          emulate a mass storage device. When used with the HID injection you
          are able to launch any number of exes you have preloaded onto the
          device. I can not overstate the power of HID injections, After opening
          a terminal on a computer you can do anything you want.

          This project has made me aware of so many vulnerabilities most
          personal computers. I'm very interested in cyber security and would
          love to use this device to further my education on the subject. At the
          very least it is a fun educational toy/tool. At about $40 to get
          started, I found it an affordable way to learn about vulnerabilities
          in personal computers.

        <p>
          This allows me to have many directories with different types of
          frameworks and servers such as Apache, Express, Python or Ruby. I also
          get to experience Linux as an os well hosting any number of servers or
          services. It will also help me learn the command line and how to use
          it. I am looking forward to learning more about Linux and web servers.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ubuntu server is very powerful and a great addition to any home
          network especially if you want to self host many web services. I am
          very impressed a Raspberry Pi 4 can run Ubuntu server and host
          Multiple websites and applications at the same time.

        <h2>Kali Linux on a Raspberry Pi 4</h2>
        <img class="displayImg" alt="Kali Linux" src="../images/Kali.png" />
        <p>
          Kali Linux is a Debian based Linux distribution that is used for
          penetration testing. It is maintained and funded by Offensive Security
          Ltd. a lot of the features have been patched, and security features
          have been added to prevent some of the attacks. There is a lot that
          does work and is super neat. I have plenty more to go through and
          learn. One thing I have learned is have strong passwords and use a
          password manager so you can have even stronger passwords. I have also
          learned that there are many vulnerabilities in personal computers and
          something as simple as clicking on a link could open your computer or
          phone up to an attacker.
        </p>
        <p>
          Im glad there is a low cost platform like the Raspberry Pi 4 to Kali
          and other Linux OS's. After my experience with Kali I may even take
          the post diploma program at Bow Valley College after I finish my
          current program software development.

        <h2>Apache 2 Web Server</h2>
        <img class="displayImg" alt="Apache" src="../images/apache.png" />
        <p>
          This website is hosted on Apache on a Raspberry Pi 4 right now. This
          was a fun project and quick to set up. What I like about Apache is
          that it is able to act as a reverse proxy. Basically you set up a file
          called a virtual host and point it to the desired port. Then you set
          up port forwarding on your router to point to the ip address. Using
          this method not only can I serve websites from citrin directories but
          I can also serve different websites from different ports. Allowing me
          to host as many different types of servers, but also frameworks.
          Apache is such a powerful tool when it comes to web hosting.I am
          looking forward to learning more about Apache and web servers.

        <h2>Express Server</h2>
        <img class="displayImg" alt="Express" src="../images/express.png" />
        <p>
          Express is a web framework for Node.js. It is used for designing and
          building web applications quickly and easily. It is a flexible Node.js
          web application framework that provides a robust set of features for
          web and mobile applications. So far I was able to set up a downloads
          and uploads server which I am ables to download files from and also
          able to upload files from. I have also used Sock.io with an Express
          Server to be able to share content with everyone connected. From what
          I can tell the possibilities are endless with Express. I'm glad I was
          able to get some experience with Express in the classroom so I was
          able to ask many questions.
