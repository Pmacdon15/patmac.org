            <p>
                PatChat is a web app that i made for fun. The website<a href="http://www.patchat.ca">PatChat.ca</a>
                is a chatroom, that I host on my unbuntu server on my raspberry pi 4. I used express and socket.io to make the 
                chatroom. I used pm2 to run the server in the background. I used apache and a vitural host point to the desired port. Apache all handles my ssl certificate.
                I used certbot to get the ssl certificate. I used a reverse proxy to point to my ip address. I used port forwarding
                to point all traffic on my ip address to my raspberry pi. Apache does the rest.
            </p>

            </ul>
            <p>
                Creating the chat room Seemed to go well afterI found a video breaking it down to its simplest 
                components. Another layer of complexity was added when I allowed Apache to handle my ssl certificates 
                as opposed to setting up the express server as an HTTPS server to begin with.I was able to get the site 
                to work properly allowing Apache to handle the SSL certificatesalthough this method does generateone 
                console error on the client sidedue toa connection failing at first.This does not affect the functionality of
                the chat room and I am still proud of the product I've produced.

                        P4wnP1 A.L.O.A. by MaMe82 is a framework which turns a Rapsberry Pi 
                        Zero W into a flexible, low-cost platform for pentesting, 
                        red teaming and physical engagements ... or into "A Little Offensive
                        Appliance".
                    </li>
                    <li>It's main super power is the ability To mimic an HID device
                        AKA inject keystrokes and mouse movements into a computer.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It's able to emulate a mass storage device. When used with 
                        the HID injection you are able to launch any number of exes you 
                        have preloaded onto the device.
                  </li>
                  <li> I can not overstate the power of HID injections, After opening a terminal 
                        on a computer you can do anything you want.

                and I have been able to set up many different types of servers on it. I have been able to set up apache, 
                express, python and ruby servers. I use pm2 to run the servers in the background. I have also been able to set up
                an Express Downloads and uploads server. I have been able to download and upload files to the server from anywhere.
                To do this port forwarding must be set up.

                The way I have my Express server set up, I can access it from anywhere in the world.
                I am able to download and upload files to the server. At a later point in time I
                may have it serve some web pages. I am looking forward to learning more about Node.js 
                and Express. I am also looking forward to learning more about web development.

            <h4>Process I followed:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Download the Kali Linux image from the official website. Look for the ARM 32 bit image.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Download the Raspberry Pi Imager from the official website.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Use the Raspberry Pi Imager to flash the Kali Linux image to the SD card.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Insert the SD card into the Raspberry Pi.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Connect the Raspberry Pi to a monitor, keyboard, and mouse and ethernet cable.

                Kali Linux is a Debian based Linux distribution that is used for penetration testing.
                Cyber security is a field that I am very intrested in. I have been using Kali Linux to learn
                about cyber security. Kali Linux is a very powerful tool and I am looking forward to learning more
                about it. I am also looking forward to learning more about cyber security and hoping to get a 
                job in the field. 
                I may even take the post deploma program at Bow Valley College after I finish my current program software
                development.

            <p>A few years backas a hobby I decided I would buy a drone.
                It kept me busy and taught me a lot about photography.
                I was able to get some really cool shots. As a family 
                we used to go camping atleast once a month. Enabling me to see a lot 
                of really cool places and photograph them. I had a mavic mini so I 
                was able to avoid registration and any training classes becuase of weight.
                There were also serval automated flight modes that made it easy to get great
                video with out even using the controller.
