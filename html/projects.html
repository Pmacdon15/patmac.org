            <h2>ALOA(A little offensive appliance)</h2>
            <img class="displayImg" alt="raspberry-pi" src="../images/aloa.jpg">
            <h4>About</h4>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        P4wnP1 A.L.O.A. by MaMe82 is a framework which turns a Rapsberry Pi 
                        Zero W into a flexible, low-cost platform for pentesting, 
                        red teaming and physical engagements ... or into "A Little Offensive
                        Appliance".
                    </li>
                    <li>It's main super power is the ability To mimic an HID device
                        AKA inject keystrokes and mouse movements into a computer.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It's able to emulate a mass storage device. When used with 
                        the HID injection you are able to launch any number of exes you 
                        have preloaded onto the device.
                  </li>
                  <li> I can not overstate the power of HID injections, After opening a terminal 
                        on a computer you can do anything you want.

                This website is hosted on the Pi right now. This was a fun project and quick
                to set up. I am looking forward to setting up a more complex web server in the 
                future. I know a bit of Node.js but it is Incompatible with Apache 2. I will
                have to learn python or php to make the websites more complicated.<br><br>If you are 
                intressted in setting up a web server on a Pi follow this link to a guide<a href="https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-apache/#:~:text=1%20Before%20we%20install%20Apache%20to%20our%20Raspberry,our%20Raspberry%20Pi%2C%20we%20now%20have%20an%20"><u>page.</u></a>

            <p>A few years backas a hobby I decided I would buy a drone.
                It kept me busy and taught me a lot about photography.
                I was able to get some really cool shots. As a family 
                we used to go camping atleast once a month. Enabling me to see a lot 
                of really cool places and photograph them. I had a mavic mini so I 
                was able to avoid registration and any training classes becuase of weight.
                There were also serval automated flight modes that made it easy to get great
                video with out even using the controller.
